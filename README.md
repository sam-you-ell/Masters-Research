Function to determine R comes from the following, 
1. Determine eigenvalues of $\alpha$
1. Block diagonalise $\alpha$, the matrix that forms our gate hamiltonian, 
2. Take the matrix, $W$ that block-diagonalises $\alpha$, and store. 
4. $R$ is then found by $R = W^{T} M W $. Where $M$ is a block diagonal matrix, formed from    the eigenvalues of $\alpha$.
