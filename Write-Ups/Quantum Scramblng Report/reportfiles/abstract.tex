    Using atypical quantum circuit models, specifically super-Clifford and non-interacting fermion circuits, we explore the dynamics of operator space entanglement entropy and the process known as scrambling. In super-Clifford circuits, we reproduce the work from Blake and Linden, and achieve a maximal entanglement entropy using the stabilizer formalism. We find that no local operators can generate non-trivial entanglement dynamics within super-Clifford circuits. By using non-interacting fermion circuits we show that fermionic systems subject to random unitary circuits exhibit weak entangling dynamics in operator space, with it's entanglement entropy saturating at a fraction of the Page value.
