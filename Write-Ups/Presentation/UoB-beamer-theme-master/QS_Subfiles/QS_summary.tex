\begin{frame}{Further Directions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Changing geometry of free-fermion circuits to boost entanglement growth. 
        \item Finding new, less constrained sets of gates in the Clifford group to scramble operators.
        \item Recent work on dual-unitary circuits has shown them to be good candidates for the study of scrambling using tensor network methods. 
        \item Including higher-order terms in fermion circuits (interaction terms). 
    \end{itemize}
