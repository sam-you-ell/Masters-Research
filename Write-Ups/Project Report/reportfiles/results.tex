\section{Results}

%U_2 is sufficient to generate the max entanglement, U_3 simply saturates the system faster as it can 

%saturation is dependent on system size and unchanged between fock and block
% max entanglement not reached for fermion systems. 

%Fock takes little time to turn saturated
%block takes a while for the gates to degrade  the domeain wall of fermi sea. -expected behaviour is showed.
