\section{Introduction}


Many-body systems and their dynamics play a central role in our understanding of modern physics. 
The dynamics of quantum many-body systems applies to a wide variety of fields in contemporary physics. 
Fields such as, quantum computation and information, modern condensed matter theory, quantum gravity.
