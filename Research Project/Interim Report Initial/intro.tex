%\textit{Background Theory on quantum scrambling and spreading - explain what it means for an operator to be scrambled}

%The scrambling of information within quantum systems has garnered considerable interest in the last two decades.

Entanglement has been the subject of intense research since it's discovery in 1935. It is a central property of quantum systems and gives quantum compuatation
it's \textit{quantum supremacy}. It is natural then, to further study this phenemona and it's dynamics, specifically the entropy of entanglement. 

Entanglement entropy has seen considerable interest in the last decade, \cite{ShenkerBlackHolesButterfly2014}
